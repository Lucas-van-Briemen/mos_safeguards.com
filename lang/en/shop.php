    "mos-safeguards-guard-fl23-long" => "<p><strong>Material gauge:</strong><br>To prevent the device from falling unnecessarily, the following points have been incorporated into the design. Firstly, the high-quality leather ‘guard’ gives a body to the entire smooth surface of the device, thus providing more grip in the hand. In addition, the ‘guard’ features a handheld which makes it extra clamped in the hand while using the device. The ‘Guard’ also offers two sturdy attachment rings for connecting a fall protection device such as the wrist, shoulder and shoulder strap provided.</p><p><strong>Size Meter:</strong><br>There is another important reason why the wrist,- and shoulder strap are included, namely to be able to work ‘hands-free’ especially when recording measurement results, climbing ladders, working in tight and narrow spaces. But also to avoid carrying the device incorrectly and/or laying it down on unsafe surfaces.</p><p><strong>Working environment:</strong><br>The device is used in a variety of environments where it is moist, dusty (fine dust), greasy and where hazardous substances may be present. Therefore, the guard should be seen as a second skin that provides additional protection for the device. The keys and screen remain easily accessible through a splash-proof window and also to protect against dirt and damage.<br>The wrist and shoulder straps are included to avoid having to put the device down in these environments, but above all to meet the safety requirements for working at height, namely that every utensil must be attached to the body. So that users and also bystanders are protected against the danger of falling.</p><p><strong>Product maintenance:</strong><br>In order to meet the quality requirements of the measurement results, the ‘guard’ is equipped with a double leather lining at crucial points, such as the housings of the fastening screws. which must remain damage-free for dismantling during periodic calibration. But also for protection of the battery cover so that batteries can also be replaced without any effort. To make it easy to take the device in and out of the ‘guard’ for maintenance, a simple locking mechanism with a push-button system was chosen.</p>",
